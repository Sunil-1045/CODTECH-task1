Overview of the Project
Project:Temperature and Humidity monitoring with DHT Sensor


Objective:
The project aims to develop a simple and efficient system to monitor and record temperature and humidity levels in real-time using a DHT sensor. This can be used for environmental monitoring, home automation, or agricultural applications.

Key Activities
Sensor Data Collection:
Use the DHT11/DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity.
Data Processing:
Capture raw data from the sensor and convert it into meaningful temperature (°C/°F) and humidity (%) values.
Display and Logging:
Display readings on an LCD screen or console.
Optionally, log the data to a local file or a cloud platform for historical analysis.

Technologies Used
Hardware:
DHT11/DHT22 Sensor
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.)
Optional: LCD Display/LEDs
Software:
TINKERCAD
